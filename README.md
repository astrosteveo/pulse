# Pulse

**Pulse** is a minimal, intelligent Zsh plugin orchestrator. It provides only what you need: enterprise-grade compinit, keybinds, and completions—nothing more, nothing less. Pulse is designed to be the heartbeat of your shell, keeping things simple, fast, and reliable.

## Philosophy: Anti-Complexity

Pulse is built on the belief that every line of code is a liability. We fight complexity at every level:

- **Minimal**: Only the essentials are included by default.
- **Functional**: Everything works, out of the box.
- **Fast**: No bloat, no slowdowns.
- **Intelligent**: Pulse knows the right order to load plugins and core features, so you don’t have to.

## Why "Pulse"?

Your shell should be alive, responsive, and reliable—the heartbeat of your workflow. Pulse orchestrates your Zsh environment so you can focus on what matters.
