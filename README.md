# Pulse

**Pulse** is a minimal, intelligent Zsh plugin orchestrator that automatically handles plugin loading, compinit timing, and optimal ordering—so you don't have to.

**Version**: 1.0.0-mvp (October 2025)

## Features

✨ **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults
🧠 **Intelligent Loading** - Automatically detects plugin types and loads them in the correct order
📦 **Declarative** - Just list your plugins, Pulse handles the rest
⚡ **Fast** - < 50ms framework overhead, < 500ms total with 15 plugins
🔧 **Flexible** - Override any behavior when you need to
🛡️ **Reliable** - Graceful error handling, one broken plugin won't break your shell

## Philosophy: Anti-Complexity

Pulse is built on the belief that every line of code is a liability. We fight complexity at every level:

- **Minimal**: Only the essentials are included by default
- **Functional**: Everything works, out of the box
- **Fast**: No bloat, no slowdowns
- **Intelligent**: Pulse knows the right order to load plugins and core features, so you don't have to

## Why "Pulse"?

Your shell should be alive, responsive, and reliable—the heartbeat of your workflow. Pulse orchestrates your Zsh environment so you can focus on what matters.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone Pulse to ~/.local/share/pulse
git clone https://github.com/astrosteveo/pulse.git ~/.local/share/pulse

# Copy the template configuration to your .zshrc
cp ~/.local/share/pulse/pulse.zshrc.template ~/.zshrc

# Edit ~/.zshrc and uncomment the plugins you want
$EDITOR ~/.zshrc

# Restart your shell
exec zsh
```

### Basic Usage

Just declare your plugins in your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
# Declare your plugins FIRST
plugins=(
  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
  zsh-users/zsh-completions
)

# Then source Pulse
source ~/.local/share/pulse/pulse.zsh
```

That's it! Pulse will:

1. Clone missing plugins from GitHub automatically
2. Detect each plugin's type (completion, syntax, theme, or standard)
3. Load them in the optimal order
4. Handle compinit at the right time

### Plugin Formats

Pulse supports multiple plugin formats:

```zsh
plugins=(
  # GitHub shorthand (most common)
  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions

  # Full Git URLs
  https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git

  # Local paths
  ~/.local/share/my-custom-plugin
  /usr/local/share/zsh/plugins/work-plugin
)
```

---

## How It Works

### The 5-Stage Loading Pipeline

Pulse automatically assigns plugins to one of five stages:

1. **Early** - Completion plugins (before compinit)
2. **Compinit** - Zsh completion system initialization
3. **Normal** - Standard plugins (most plugins go here)
4. **Late** - Syntax highlighting and themes (must load last)
5. **Deferred** - Lazy-loaded plugins (future feature)

You never have to think about this—Pulse detects plugin types by analyzing their structure:

- **Completion plugins**: Contain `_*` files or `completions/` directory → Early stage
- **Syntax plugins**: Names like `*-syntax-highlighting` → Late stage
- **Theme plugins**: Contain `.zsh-theme` files → Late stage
- **Standard plugins**: Everything else → Normal stage

### Plugin Detection

No plugin modifications required! Pulse uses smart pattern matching:

```text
plugin/
├── _command           ← Completion file detected
├── completions/       ← Completion directory detected
└── plugin.zsh

zsh-syntax-highlighting/   ← Name pattern detected
└── zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh

my-theme/
└── my-theme.zsh-theme     ← Theme file detected
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The only required configuration is the `plugins` array:

```zsh
plugins=(
  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
)
```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Disable Specific Plugins

```zsh
# Temporarily disable plugins without removing them from the list
pulse_disabled_plugins=(
  unwanted-plugin
  another-disabled-plugin
)
```

#### Override Plugin Load Stage

```zsh
# Force a plugin to load in a specific stage
typeset -gA pulse_plugin_stage
pulse_plugin_stage[my-custom-plugin]="late"
pulse_plugin_stage[another-plugin]="early"
```

#### Custom Directories

```zsh
# Change where Pulse stores plugins (default: ~/.local/share/pulse)
export PULSE_DIR="${HOME}/.pulse"

# Change cache directory (default: ~/.cache/pulse)
export PULSE_CACHE_DIR="${HOME}/.pulse/cache"
```

#### Debug Mode

```zsh
# Enable verbose logging to troubleshoot issues
export PULSE_DEBUG=1
```

---

## Examples

### Minimal Setup

```zsh
plugins=(
  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
)

source ~/.local/share/pulse/pulse.zsh
```

### Developer Setup

```zsh
plugins=(
  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
  zsh-users/zsh-completions
)

source ~/.local/share/pulse/pulse.zsh
```

### Power User Setup

```zsh
# Optional: Enable debug mode
export PULSE_DEBUG=1

plugins=(
  # Suggestions and highlighting
  zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
  zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
  zsh-users/zsh-completions

  # Navigation
  agkozak/zsh-z

  # Git enhancements
  wfxr/forgit
)

source ~/.local/share/pulse/pulse.zsh
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading

Check if the plugin is in the disabled list:

```zsh
echo ${pulse_disabled_plugins[@]}
```

Enable debug mode to see what's happening:

```zsh
PULSE_DEBUG=1 exec zsh
```

Verify the plugin directory exists:

```zsh
ls -la ~/.local/share/pulse/plugins/
```

### Slow Startup

Check which plugins are taking time:

```zsh
# Time your shell startup
time zsh -ic exit

# Enable debug mode to see load times
PULSE_DEBUG=1 zsh
```

### Completion Not Working

Ensure completion plugins load before compinit:

```zsh
# Pulse handles this automatically, but you can verify:
echo ${pulse_plugin_stages[zsh-completions]}  # Should show "early"
```
