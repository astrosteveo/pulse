# Implementation Plan: Intelligent Declarative Zsh Framework (Pulse)

**Branch**: `001-build-a-zsh` | **Date**: 2025-10-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-zsh/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Pulse is a minimal, intelligent Zsh plugin orchestrator that enables declarative shell configuration. Users specify their desired shell state (plugins, completions, keybindings) and Pulse automatically handles the complex orchestration—determining optimal load order, managing compinit timing, and ensuring compatibility. Unlike traditional frameworks, Pulse ships with everything disabled by default, providing only a comprehensive template .zshrc with examples. This "à la carte" approach combines the ease of oh-my-zsh with the performance and simplicity of minimal loaders like zsh_unplugged.

**Core Value**: Remove the PhD-level Zsh knowledge requirement from plugin management while maintaining minimal overhead (<50ms) and fast startup times (<500ms with 15 plugins).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Zsh (compatible with Zsh 5.0+)
**Primary Dependencies**: Zsh builtins, POSIX utilities, Git (for plugin management)
**Storage**: Plugin cache in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/pulse or ~/.cache/pulse
**Testing**: bats-core (Bash Automated Testing System) for integration tests, custom unit test harness for Zsh functions
**Target Platform**: Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, BSD) with Zsh 5.0+
**Project Type**: Single project (Zsh plugin orchestrator)
**Performance Goals**: Shell startup impact <50ms, plugin load <100ms per plugin, total startup <500ms with 15 plugins
**Constraints**: Zero configuration by default, no external dependencies beyond Git, minimal memory footprint
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user shell environment, supports 50+ plugins efficiently

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Radical Simplicity (Principle I)

- [x] Feature serves 90% of users (not edge case functionality)
  - **PASS**: Plugin management and declarative configuration are universal needs for Zsh users
- [x] No simpler alternative exists to achieve the same goal
  - **PASS**: Manual plugin management requires deep Zsh knowledge; existing frameworks are either too complex (oh-my-zsh) or too minimal (unplugged)
- [x] Feature justification documented (why it's essential)
  - **PASS**: Core value is removing complexity barrier while maintaining performance
- [x] Deletion considered before addition
  - **PASS**: Starting from zero—everything disabled by default, only examples provided

### Quality Over Features (Principle II)

- [x] Code style follows Zsh conventions
  - **PASS**: Will use standard Zsh idioms, fpath manipulation, autoload functions
- [x] Error handling strategy defined
  - **PASS**: Graceful degradation, clear error messages, debug logging (FR-018 through FR-021)
- [x] Documentation approach specified
  - **PASS**: Inline comments, template .zshrc as self-documentation, separate quickstart guide
- [x] Performance impact assessed
  - **PASS**: <50ms overhead, <500ms total startup with 15 plugins (SC-002, SC-008)

### Test-Driven Reliability (Principle III) - NON-NEGOTIABLE

- [x] Test strategy defined (unit, integration, real-world scenarios)
  - **PASS**: bats-core for integration tests, custom harness for unit tests, test with multiple Zsh versions
- [x] Test environment requirements documented
  - **PASS**: Requires Zsh 5.0+, bats-core, Git, test fixtures for mock plugins
- [x] Coverage targets specified
  - **PASS**: 100% coverage for core plugin engine, 90% for utilities, all user scenarios tested
- [x] Tests will be written BEFORE implementation
  - **PASS**: TDD mandatory per constitution, integration tests define expected behavior first

### Consistent User Experience (Principle IV)

- [x] Default behavior documented and sensible
  - **PASS**: Empty shell by default (FR-016), template shows all options, no surprises
- [x] No breaking changes OR major version bump justified
  - **PASS**: New feature (v1.0.0), no prior version to break
- [x] User feedback approach specified
  - **PASS**: Clear error messages (FR-018), debug mode (FR-023), graceful degradation (FR-019)
- [x] Backward compatibility addressed
  - **PASS**: Compatible with standard Zsh plugins (FR-031), supports migration from other frameworks (SC-007)

### Zero Configuration (Principle V)

- [x] Works without configuration OR configuration unavoidable (justify)
  - **PASS**: Works immediately—empty config gives minimal shell, template provides examples
- [x] Smart defaults defined
  - **PASS**: Intelligent plugin ordering (FR-009), automatic compinit timing (FR-010), XDG paths
- [x] Auto-detection strategy specified
  - **PASS**: Detect plugin types by structure/filenames, infer load stages, cache metadata
- [x] Configuration options minimized
  - **PASS**: Core framework has zero config; plugins declared as simple list; optional overrides for edge cases

**Constitution Check Result**: ✅ **PASSED** - All principles satisfied, proceed to Phase 0

**Structure Decision**: Pulse uses a single-project structure with modular
lib/*.zsh files. Each module is independently loadable and testable. New
features extend existing modules or add new modules following the pulse_*
naming convention.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**No violations** - All constitution principles satisfied. No complexity justifications needed.
