# Specification Quality Checklist: Intelligent Declarative Zsh Framework (Pulse)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality ✅

- Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of specific code structures, functions, or data types)
- Focuses on user outcomes: declarative configuration, intelligent loading, fast startup
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness ✅

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- All 33 functional requirements are testable with clear success/failure conditions
- Success criteria include specific metrics (5 minutes, 500ms, 90%, 50ms overhead)
- Success criteria describe observable user outcomes, not implementation details
- 5 detailed user stories with acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- 7 edge cases identified covering failure modes and boundary conditions
- Scope is bounded by 33 explicit functional requirements
- Assumptions section explicitly states dependencies (Zsh 5.0+, Git, network for initial setup)

### Feature Readiness ✅

- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- User scenarios cover all priority levels (P1: core functionality, P2: usability, P3: enhancements)
- Measurable outcomes include time-based metrics, user satisfaction, and technical performance
- Specification maintains abstraction: describes "what" users need, not "how" to implement

**Overall Status**: PASSED - Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

All checklist items are complete. The specification provides a clear, complete, and technology-agnostic description of the Pulse framework feature.
