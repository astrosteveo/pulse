# Feature Specification: Intelligent Declarative Zsh Framework (Pulse)

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-zsh`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a zsh framework named Pulse that is based on the idea of mattmc3/zsh_unplugged and mattmc3/zephyr. The end result will be a ready to use framework that is ready to easily be configured with some sensible settings, features, and defaults. Default is off, and we'll provide a commented out template zshrc like ohmyzsh does that allows users to customize things. The idea for the plugin loader is to be more than just a dummy loader, but to be intelligent and makes sure your plugins are loaded at the proper time, without needing to have a PhD in Zsh. I want to extrapolate the logic away from the user, the user deals with specifying what the state of their shell should be when they start it up (eg: declarative configuration)."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Plugin Loading Without Configuration Complexity (Priority: P1)

A user wants to use popular Zsh plugins without understanding load order, dependencies, or initialization timing. They should be able to declare what plugins they want and have Pulse intelligently handle all the orchestration.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition—removing complexity from plugin management. Without this, Pulse is just another plugin loader.

**Independent Test**: Install Pulse, declare 5 common plugins (e.g., syntax-highlighting, autosuggestions, completions, git, fzf) in a simple list format. Start a new shell. All plugins work correctly without the user specifying load order or worrying about when compinit runs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh Zsh installation with Pulse, **When** user lists plugins in their config file, **Then** Pulse automatically determines correct load order based on plugin types
2. **Given** plugins with initialization requirements, **When** shell starts, **Then** Pulse ensures compinit runs at the optimal time without user intervention
3. **Given** conflicting plugins, **When** shell loads, **Then** Pulse detects conflicts and provides clear guidance
4. **Given** a plugin that requires late loading, **When** shell starts, **Then** Pulse defers that plugin until after core shell setup completes

---

### User Story 2 - Instant Productivity with Template Configuration (Priority: P2)

A new user wants to get started quickly without spending hours reading documentation or copying configurations from various sources. They should have access to a comprehensive template that shows all available options with sensible defaults pre-configured.

**Why this priority**: Reduces barrier to entry and demonstrates Pulse's capabilities immediately. A good template serves as self-documentation.

**Independent Test**: Install Pulse, copy the template .zshrc file, uncomment desired features. Restart shell and have a fully functional, performant setup in under 5 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new Pulse installation, **When** user accesses the template .zshrc, **Then** all configuration options are clearly documented with comments
2. **Given** the template configuration, **When** user enables common features (git aliases, completions, keybinds), **Then** features work immediately without additional setup
3. **Given** default settings are "off", **When** user doesn't modify template, **Then** Pulse provides minimal, fast shell with no unexpected behavior
4. **Given** template examples for popular setups, **When** user uncomments a profile (e.g., "developer", "minimal"), **Then** appropriate plugins and settings are activated

---

### User Story 3 - Declarative Shell State Management (Priority: P1)

A user wants to define their desired shell state (plugins loaded, completions enabled, keybindings set, aliases defined) in a simple, readable format. The system should handle all the imperative steps to achieve that state.

**Why this priority**: This is the philosophical foundation of Pulse—declarative over imperative configuration. This enables reproducibility and clarity.

**Independent Test**: Create a configuration file listing desired state (10 plugins, specific completion settings, custom keybinds). Share this file with another user. Both users get identical shell behavior without understanding Zsh internals.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a declarative configuration file, **When** user specifies plugins as a simple list, **Then** Pulse handles cloning, updating, and loading automatically
2. **Given** shell state requirements (completions on, vi mode, specific prompt), **When** configuration is loaded, **Then** Pulse orchestrates initialization in correct order
3. **Given** multiple machines with different environments, **When** same configuration file is used, **Then** behavior is consistent across all machines
4. **Given** changes to desired state, **When** configuration is updated, **Then** next shell startup reflects new state without manual cleanup

---

### User Story 4 - Performance Optimization and Lazy Loading (Priority: P3)

A user with many plugins wants fast shell startup times. The system should intelligently defer loading non-critical plugins until they're actually needed.

**Why this priority**: Important for user experience but not critical for MVP. Intelligent loading differentiates Pulse from basic loaders.

**Independent Test**: Configure 15 plugins. Measure shell startup time. Compare against manually optimized loading. Pulse should match or exceed manual optimization without user effort.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** plugins that aren't immediately needed, **When** shell starts, **Then** Pulse defers loading until first use
2. **Given** a plugin triggered by a specific command, **When** that command is first executed, **Then** plugin loads transparently before command runs
3. **Given** multiple shells open simultaneously, **When** plugin loading occurs, **Then** no race conditions or duplicate loads happen
4. **Given** startup time constraints, **When** user specifies performance budget, **Then** Pulse prioritizes critical plugins and defers others

---

### User Story 5 - Intelligent Plugin Discovery and Updates (Priority: P3)

A user wants to discover compatible plugins and keep them updated without manual intervention. The system should provide simple commands for plugin management.

**Why this priority**: Nice to have but not essential for initial release. Can be added after core framework is stable.

**Independent Test**: Run a discovery command to see popular/recommended plugins. Install one with a simple command. Update all plugins with another command. All operations complete successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Pulse is installed, **When** user runs plugin discovery command, **Then** list of curated, compatible plugins is displayed
2. **Given** outdated plugins, **When** user runs update command, **Then** all plugins are updated without breaking configurations
3. **Given** a plugin name, **When** user adds it to configuration, **Then** Pulse fetches and integrates it automatically on next shell start
4. **Given** plugin metadata, **When** listing installed plugins, **Then** version, source, and load order are displayed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a plugin repository is unavailable or deleted?
- How does the system handle plugins with conflicting keybindings or aliases?
- What if a plugin crashes or produces errors during initialization?
- How does Pulse behave in restricted environments (no network access, limited permissions)?
- What happens when user specifies circular dependencies between plugins?
- How does the system handle shell sessions started in parallel?
- What if user's .zshrc contains syntax errors?

- Users have Git available for plugin management (standard developer tool)
- Network access is available for initial plugin download (can work offline after setup)
- Users prefer sensible defaults over extensive configuration (aligns with project philosophy)
- Plugin load order can be intelligently inferred from plugin type and common patterns
- Most users want fast startup time over loading everything immediately

### Key Entities

- **Plugin**: A Git repository containing Zsh scripts, identified by URL or short name, with metadata about type and loading requirements
- **Configuration State**: The desired state of the shell defined by user, including enabled plugins, completion settings, keybindings, and behavior options
- **Load Stage**: A phase in shell initialization (early, compinit, normal, late, deferred) that determines when plugins are sourced
- **Template Profile**: A pre-configured set of plugins and settings for specific use cases (minimal, developer, power user)
