## Notes

This checklist validates **requirements quality** for release readiness, focusing on:

1. **Documentation Completeness** - All requirements documented for production release
2. **Security & Safety** - Comprehensive coverage of security requirements (FR-008, FR-009)
3. **Traceability** - Bidirectional traceability from requirements through tests to implementation

**Usage**: Review each item to validate that requirements are clearly written, complete, consistent, and measurable. This is NOT a test of whether the implementation works - it tests whether the requirements themselves are release-ready.

**Passing Criteria**: ≥95% items checked indicates requirements are production-ready with complete documentation.
