## Findings by Severity

### CRITICAL (Implementation Blockers)

#### CA1: TDD Not Enforced for Foundation Tasks

**Category**: Constitution Alignment
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Artifacts**: tasks.md (T004-T006, T008-T010)

**Issue**: Constitution v1.1.0 mandates "Tests written FIRST, 100% core coverage, TDD mandatory" but foundation tasks (T004-T006: output formatting/exit codes/env parsing, T008-T010: prerequisite checks) lack explicit test-first specifications. Only user story phases (T007, T021, T025) follow TDD workflow.

**Impact**: Violates NON-NEGOTIABLE constitution principle; risks untested core utilities.

**Evidence**:

- T004 (output formatting): No test file specified
- T008 (Zsh version check): Implementation shown, but no preceding test task
- T010 (write permissions): No test specification before implementation

**Remediation**:

1. Insert test tasks before T004-T010 following TDD pattern:
   - T003.5: Write tests for output formatting functions
   - T007.5: Write tests for prerequisite check functions (before T008-T010)
2. Update task dependencies to enforce test-first ordering
3. Add acceptance criteria verifying tests fail before implementation (Red phase)

---

#### A1: Undefined Behavior for Wrong Configuration Order

**Category**: Ambiguity
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Artifacts**: spec.md (FR-004), tasks.md (T023), configuration-patching.md

**Issue**: FR-004 requires "Update the user's Zsh configuration to declare the `plugins` array before sourcing `pulse.zsh`" but doesn't specify what to do if existing configuration has WRONG order (source before plugins). T023 includes comment "If order wrong, could fix here (future enhancement)" - behavior is undefined.

**Impact**: Blocks implementation of US2 (idempotent re-run); violates Zero Configuration principle if manual fixing required.

**Evidence**:

- spec.md FR-004: "ensuring the configuration order is preserved" (ambiguous)
- T023 patch_zshrc(): Returns 0 even if order validation fails
- configuration-patching.md: Defines DETECT and INSERT modes but UPDATE mode is underspecified

**Remediation**:

1. Add decision to spec.md FR-004: Specify whether installer should (a) auto-fix order, (b) warn user with remediation steps, or (c) fail installation
2. Implement chosen behavior in T023
3. Add test case to T021 verifying wrong-order handling
4. Update configuration-patching.md contract with UPDATE mode algorithm

---

### HIGH (Major Gaps)

#### U5: UPDATE Mode Not Implemented Despite Contract Definition

**Category**: Underspecification
**Severity**: HIGH
**Artifacts**: configuration-patching.md, tasks.md (T023)

**Issue**: configuration-patching.md contract defines three modes (DETECT, INSERT, UPDATE) but T023 only implements DETECT and INSERT. UPDATE mode (for modifying existing Pulse blocks) is specified in contract but missing from implementation plan.

**Impact**: Users cannot update plugin lists or fix configuration issues without manual editing.

**Evidence**:

- configuration-patching.md: "Mode: UPDATE - Existing Pulse block found and requires modification"
- T023: Only checks for block existence, doesn't implement modification logic
- No task addresses updating plugins array within existing block

**Remediation**:

1. Add T023.5: Implement UPDATE mode for in-place block modification
2. Define UPDATE trigger conditions (e.g., PULSE_UPDATE_CONFIG=true env var)
3. Add tests verifying plugin array updates preserve user entries
4. Update T023 acceptance criteria to include UPDATE mode

---

#### CG4: Security Considerations Not Implemented

**Category**: Coverage Gap
**Severity**: HIGH
**Artifacts**: installer-behavior.md (Security Considerations section), tasks.md

**Issue**: installer-behavior.md contract specifies security considerations (HTTPS verification, backup creation, read-only operations on verification) but no task validates these practices.

**Impact**: Installer vulnerable to MITM attacks, repository spoofing, or unsafe file operations.

**Evidence**:

- Contract: "Repository cloning MUST use HTTPS protocol"
- T012: Uses `git clone` without explicit HTTPS enforcement or verification
- No task validates SSL certificates or repository authenticity
- No checksum validation for downloaded artifacts

**Remediation**:

1. Add T011.5: Implement security validation task
   - Verify Git uses HTTPS (reject git:// or http://)
   - Validate SSL certificates (set GIT_SSL_VERIFY)
   - Add optional GPG signature verification for releases
2. Add security test cases to T025 (failure modes)
3. Update installer-behavior.md with implementation details

---

#### U3: Verification Doesn't Report Detailed Issues

**Category**: Underspecification
**Severity**: HIGH
**Artifacts**: spec.md (FR-006), tasks.md (T017)

**Issue**: FR-006 requires "automatic verification... and report any detected issues with remediation guidance" but T017 only implements binary pass/fail. No detailed issue reporting or specific remediation steps.

**Impact**: Users receive "Verification failed" message without actionable debugging information.

**Evidence**:

- FR-006: "report any detected issues with remediation guidance"
- T017 verify_installation(): Only checks if Pulse loads, no diagnostics
- Error message: "Restore backup and retry with PULSE_DEBUG=1" (generic)

**Remediation**:

1. Enhance T017 to capture subshell errors and parse failure reasons:
   - Syntax errors in .zshrc
   - Missing pulse.zsh file
   - Plugin loading failures
2. Provide targeted remediation for each failure type
3. Add T017.5: Implement detailed verification report function
4. Update tests to verify remediation message quality

---

### MEDIUM (Polish/Enhancement)

#### D1: Duplication in Write Permission Check

**Category**: Duplication
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Artifacts**: tasks.md (T010, T026)

**Issue**: `check_write_permissions()` logic defined in T010, but T026 redefines prerequisite validation without referencing existing implementation.

**Remediation**: Change T026 description to "Enhance validate_prerequisites() from T011 to add detailed error messages" rather than redefining functions.

---

#### D2: Duplication in Prerequisite Validation

**Category**: Duplication
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Artifacts**: tasks.md (T011, T026)

**Issue**: `validate_prerequisites()` defined in T011, then completely redefined in T026 with enhanced messages. Should be incremental enhancement.

**Remediation**: T026 should explicitly call out it's modifying T011 implementation, not replacing it.

---

#### U1: Current Shell Detection Not Addressed

**Category**: Underspecification
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Artifacts**: spec.md (Edge Cases), tasks.md

**Issue**: Edge case "User runs the installer from a shell that is not Zsh" listed but no task addresses detecting current shell vs target shell for configuration.

**Remediation**: Add T011.5: Detect current shell and warn if not Zsh (optional enhancement for future).

---

#### U2: Nested Configuration Not Handled

**Category**: Underspecification
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Artifacts**: spec.md (Edge Cases), tasks.md (T015)

**Issue**: Edge case "User has a custom `.zshrc` structure (e.g., sourcing multiple files)" not handled - T015 only modifies main .zshrc.

**Remediation**: Document limitation in TROUBLESHOOTING.md; consider future enhancement for sourced file detection.

---

#### CG1: Documentation Publishing Not Specified

**Category**: Coverage Gap
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Artifacts**: spec.md (FR-007), tasks.md (Phase 6)

**Issue**: FR-007 requires "Publish installation documentation" but tasks only cover creating QUICKSTART.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md - no task for publishing/hosting.

**Remediation**: Add Phase 6 task: "Update GitHub README.md and repository docs/ with installation instructions" or clarify FR-007 means "create" not "host".

---

#### CG2: Telemetry Measurement Gap

**Category**: Coverage Gap
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Artifacts**: spec.md (SC-004), data-model.md (InstallerTelemetry), tasks.md

**Issue**: SC-004 measures "Installation-related support tickets decrease by 60%" but no telemetry collection implemented.

**Remediation**: Either (a) remove SC-004 as unmeasurable, or (b) add optional telemetry task for future iteration.

---

#### I4: Unused Data Model Entities

**Category**: Inconsistency
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Artifacts**: data-model.md, tasks.md

**Issue**: data-model.md defines 5 entities but only 3 are implemented in tasks (InstallationSession, PrerequisiteCheck, ConfigurationPatch). VerificationResult and InstallerTelemetry are unused.

**Remediation**: Either implement these entities in tasks or remove from data model as future scope.

---

### LOW (Documentation)

#### A2: Interactive Directory Selection Not Implemented

**Category**: Ambiguity
**Severity**: LOW
**Artifacts**: spec.md (FR-003)

**Issue**: FR-003 mentions "user-selected alternative" directory but only env var override implemented, no interactive selection.

**Remediation**: Clarify in spec.md that alternative directory is via env var only (PULSE_INSTALL_DIR).

---

#### A3: User Timing Metric Not Measurable

**Category**: Ambiguity
**Severity**: LOW
**Artifacts**: spec.md (SC-001)

**Issue**: SC-001 "90% of first-time users complete installation... within 2 minutes" has no measurement mechanism.

**Remediation**: Rephrase as "Installation script completes within 120 seconds on reference hardware" (testable).

---

#### D3: Missing Explicit Dependency

**Category**: Duplication
**Severity**: LOW
**Artifacts**: tasks.md (T004, T026)

**Issue**: T026 uses output formatting functions from T004 but doesn't list T004 as dependency.

**Remediation**: Add T004 to T026 dependencies.

---

#### I1: Plan Re-validation Inconsistency

**Category**: Inconsistency
**Severity**: LOW
**Artifacts**: plan.md (Post-Phase 1 Re-validation), tasks.md

**Issue**: plan.md claims "Test-Driven Reliability" gate passed in Post-Phase 1 check, but CA1 shows TDD not enforced for foundation tasks.

**Remediation**: Update plan.md re-validation to note TDD coverage gap and resolution plan.

---

#### I2: Task Count Ambiguity

**Category**: Inconsistency
**Severity**: LOW
**Artifacts**: tasks.md (Overview)

**Issue**: tasks.md claims "Total Tasks: 27" but Phase 6 describes "~6 tasks" without concrete IDs, making total ambiguous.

**Remediation**: Either assign T028-T033 IDs to Phase 6 tasks or change total to "27+ tasks".

---

#### I3: Test Coverage Inconsistency

**Category**: Inconsistency
**Severity**: LOW
**Artifacts**: quickstart.md (Test 3), tasks.md (T025)

**Issue**: quickstart.md describes comprehensive "Prerequisite Failure Handling" test but T025 only covers missing Git and unwritable directory - missing Zsh version test.

**Remediation**: Add missing Zsh version test case to T025.

---

#### CG3: Performance Benchmark Not Implemented

**Category**: Coverage Gap
**Severity**: LOW
**Artifacts**: quickstart.md (Performance Benchmarks), tasks.md (Phase 6)

**Issue**: quickstart.md includes performance benchmark expectations but no task implements timing/benchmark collection.

**Remediation**: Add Phase 6 task: "Implement performance benchmark test measuring installation time".

---

#### CG5: Network Failure Not Handled

**Category**: Coverage Gap
**Severity**: LOW
**Artifacts**: spec.md (Edge Cases), tasks.md (T012)

**Issue**: Edge case "Network connectivity drops mid-install" listed but T012 git clone has no retry logic or partial state cleanup.

**Remediation**: Document as known limitation; add to future enhancements list.
