# Specification Quality Checklist: Polish & Refinement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification ready for planning phase

**Iterations**: 1

**Changes Made**:
1. Removed implementation details (file paths, specific technologies, formats)
2. Rewrote Success Metrics with quantifiable, measurable targets
3. Simplified language to be accessible to non-technical stakeholders
4. Rewrote Functional Requirements to focus on user outcomes, not technical details
5. Made Non-Functional Requirements technology-agnostic

**Notes**:
- All 19 functional requirements map to user stories with acceptance criteria
- Success metrics include specific numbers (5 seconds, 100% accuracy, 90% adoption, etc.)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions documented in Key Clarifications
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, avoiding HOW (implementation details reserved for plan.md)
