# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Zsh Framework Modules

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

âœ… **All validation items passed**

The specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive user stories covering all major framework aspects
- Clear prioritization (P1: completions/keybindings, P2: options/directory, P3: prompt/utilities)
- Each user story is independently testable
- 46 functional requirements covering all framework modules
- 12 success criteria with measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
- Well-defined key entities explaining framework concepts
- Strong alignment with Zero Configuration principle

**Minor note:**

- Line 6 has a bare URL (markdown linting warning) - cosmetic only, doesn't affect spec quality
