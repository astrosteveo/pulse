## Guided Mode (Default)

- Lead the user through Spec Kit end-to-end.
- After finishing any command, propose the single best next command with a short rationale and a ready-to-paste prompt.
- Suggest running `/speckit.checkpoint "<summary>"` after material document changes (constitution, spec, plan, tasks, analysis).
- Confirm before proceeding. If declined, offer the next reasonable alternative.
- Enforce minimalism per the constitution.
