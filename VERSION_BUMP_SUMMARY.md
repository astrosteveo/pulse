## Next Steps (Requires Manual Action)

The tag has been created locally on this branch. After this PR is merged to main:

1. **Push the tag** (requires repository maintainer):
   ```bash
   git push origin v0.3.0
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Release**:
   - Navigate to https://github.com/astrosteveo/pulse/releases/new
   - Select tag v0.3.0
   - Add release notes (template provided in TAG_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
   - Publish the release

3. **Verify the release**:
   - Check that the tag appears on GitHub
   - Verify the release is visible on the releases page
   - Test the installer with the new version

## Notes

- This is the first official release of Pulse
- The tag points to the version bump commit on this PR branch
- After merging to main, the tag should remain on the same commit (which will be in main's history)
- The version bump follows semantic versioning practices
- All documentation has been updated to reflect the new version
