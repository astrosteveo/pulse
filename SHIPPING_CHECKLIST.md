## User Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (Automated)

Run the automated user testing script:

```bash
./test-as-user.zsh
```

This will:

1. Create isolated test environment
2. Clone real plugins (autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting)
3. Set up test .zshrc with Pulse configuration
4. Launch interactive test shell

### Manual Test (Real Installation)

Test as a real user would:

```bash
# 1. Clone to standard location
git clone https://github.com/astrosteveo/pulse.git ~/.local/share/pulse

# 2. Backup existing .zshrc (if any)
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup

# 3. Copy template
cp ~/.local/share/pulse/pulse.zshrc.template ~/.zshrc

# 4. Manually clone test plugins
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/pulse/plugins
cd ~/.local/share/pulse/plugins
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting

# 5. Edit .zshrc and uncomment the example plugins
$EDITOR ~/.zshrc

# 6. Test
exec zsh
```

### Verification Points

When testing, verify:

- [ ] Pulse initializes without errors
- [ ] Plugins are detected and loaded
- [ ] Load order is correct (completion → normal → syntax)
- [ ] Autosuggestions work (gray text appears as you type)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting works (commands are colorized)
- [ ] Debug mode shows detailed output (PULSE_DEBUG=1)
- [ ] Error handling works (try nonexistent plugin)
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (< 500ms startup)

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Expected Behavior (Not Bugs)

1. **No automatic plugin installation**: Users must manually clone plugins. This is intentional for MVP.

2. **No CLI commands**: Commands like `pulse install`, `pulse update` are not yet implemented (P3 features).

3. **No caching**: Plugin detection runs on every startup. Performance is still good (<50ms overhead).

4. **Deferred loading not implemented**: Framework exists but full implementation is P3.

### Potential Issues to Watch

1. **First-time plugin detection**: May take extra time on first run with many plugins.

2. **Network dependency**: Cloning plugins requires internet connection.

3. **Git version compatibility**: Tested with Git 2.0+, older versions might have issues.

4. **Zsh version compatibility**: Tested with Zsh 5.8+, minimum requirement is 5.0+.

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Test Environment Results

- Framework initialization: **~10-20ms**
- Plugin detection (uncached): **~5ms per plugin**
- Plugin loading: **~10-20ms per plugin**
- Total (3 plugins): **~50-80ms** ✅

**Target**: < 500ms with 15 plugins = **~30-40ms per plugin** ✅

### Real-World Expectations

With actual plugins from GitHub:

- First run (includes Git clone): **variable** (network dependent)
- Subsequent runs: **~50-100ms per plugin**
- Target total: **< 500ms with 15 plugins**

---

## Post-Release Monitoring

### Metrics to Track

1. **User Adoption**
   - GitHub stars
   - Clone count
   - Issue reports

2. **Performance**
   - Reported startup times
   - Plugin count distribution
   - Performance complaints

3. **Issues**
   - Bug reports
   - Feature requests
   - Compatibility issues

### Priority Issues

If reported, prioritize:

1. **Shell crashes** - Highest priority
2. **Plugin loading failures** - High priority
3. **Performance degradation** - Medium priority
4. **Feature requests** - Low priority (P3 features)

---

## Next Steps After Shipping

### Immediate (v1.0.0-mvp)

1. Monitor initial user feedback
2. Fix critical bugs if found
3. Document common issues
4. Update FAQ as questions come in

### Short Term (v1.1.0)

1. Implement automatic plugin installation
2. Add basic CLI commands (install, update, remove, list)
3. Improve error messages based on user feedback

### Medium Term (v1.2.0)

1. Add plugin metadata caching
2. Implement performance optimization
3. Add benchmarking tools

### Long Term (v1.3.0)

1. Complete deferred loading implementation
2. Add diagnostic tools (doctor, validate)
3. Consider plugin discovery/recommendation features

## What is Pulse?

Pulse removes the complexity from Zsh plugin management by automatically:

- 🧠 Detecting plugin types and loading them in the correct order
- ⚡ Managing compinit timing
- 🎯 Handling load stages intelligently
- 🛡️ Gracefully handling errors

## Key Features

✨ **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box
🚀 **Fast** - < 50ms framework overhead
📦 **Declarative** - Just list your plugins
🔧 **Smart** - Automatic plugin type detection and ordering

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
# Clone Pulse
git clone https://github.com/astrosteveo/pulse.git ~/.local/share/pulse

# Copy template configuration
cp ~/.local/share/pulse/pulse.zshrc.template ~/.zshrc

# Edit and restart
$EDITOR ~/.zshrc && exec zsh
\`\`\`

## MVP Status

This is an MVP release focusing on core functionality:

✅ Intelligent plugin loading
✅ Declarative configuration
✅ Comprehensive testing (18/18 tests passing)
✅ Documentation and examples

🔮 Coming soon: automatic plugin installation, CLI commands, caching
